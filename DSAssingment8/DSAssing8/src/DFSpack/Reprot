Completing this coding assignment proved to be quite challenging, but I successfully accomplished the tasks. While I had a theoretical understanding of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Topological Sort, translating that knowledge into actual code presented its own set of challenges.

I faced uncertainties in implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm and Topological Sort, 
especially when dealing with cycle detection in the latter. Seeking assistance from a TA was crucial,
 and their suggestion to modify the code to detect cycles, delete the problematic edge, 
 and then return the topological order was immensely helpful.
 This approach significantly improved my code as the previous version only indicated cycle detection without providing the desired order.

The time complexity of both algorithms in my code is O(V^2). 
Recognizing the potential for improvement, I acknowledge that using a Priority Queue could have enhanced the complexity. 
Overall, this assignment deepened my understanding of these algorithms and the nuances of translating theoretical knowledge into practical code.
