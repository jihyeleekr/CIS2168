I have finished the assignment.
 It was quite challenging, especially when working on the merge sort.
 I found myself puzzled about whether I should create a new array each time I divide the original array in half.
 As for pivot sort, which is similar to quicksort, I ended up using a different approach compared to the one we saw in the lecture slides.
 Printing out the steps in an understandable manner also proved to be a bit tricky, but Professor said it is okay even if it does not show each soring steps
 unless it returns the correct sorted array.
Nevertheless, I believe this assignment provided excellent practice in comprehending various sorting algorithms.
