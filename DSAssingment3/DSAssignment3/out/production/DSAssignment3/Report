Assignment 3 Report
1) The program is completed.
2) Because the input string is in infix form I made the function which converts infix to postfix.
    - Create the stack which stores the operators
    - Check each characters in infix then put the numbers in postfix
    - Use while loop and if statements to figure out ()'s
3) Then do the calculation by using postfix.
4) I think there is better way to calculating postfix, but I am not sure how can I improve current code.
